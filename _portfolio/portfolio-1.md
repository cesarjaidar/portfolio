Description:
This project applies sentiment analysis and text preprocessing to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. Key components include:

📄 Data Loading: Import and inspect labeled movie review data.

💬 Sentiment Analysis:
TextBlob: Classifies reviews using polarity.
VADER: Performs sentiment analysis for comparison and evaluates model accuracy.

🧹 Text Preprocessing:
Convert text to lowercase.
Remove punctuation, special characters, and stop words.
Apply stemming using NLTK’s PorterStemmer.

🏗️ Feature Extraction:
Create a bag-of-words matrix from processed text.
Generate a TF-IDF matrix to weigh words by importance.

📊 Model Evaluation: Compares model performance to random guessing, ensuring the sentiment classifier adds value.
This project lays the groundwork for building custom sentiment models and highlights the importance of thorough text preprocessing in natural language processing (NLP).

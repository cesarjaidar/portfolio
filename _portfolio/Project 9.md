Description:
The project explores various classification models to predict loan approval outcomes. Key highlights include:

📊 Data preparation and preprocessing (handling missing data, encoding categorical variables).

🔍 Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) within a scalable pipeline.

🧮 Grid search to optimize hyperparameters for KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models.

📈 Model comparison and performance evaluation using cross-validation and test set accuracy.

🏆 Logistic Regression emerged as the best-performing model with an accuracy of 82.29%, surpassing the default KNN model.

The project demonstrates the power of hyperparameter tuning and model selection to improve predictive performance in binary classification tasks.

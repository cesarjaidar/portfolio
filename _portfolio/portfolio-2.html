Description:
This project performs sentiment analysis and classification on movie reviews using custom text preprocessing and machine learning models. Key components include:

🧹 Text Preprocessing:
Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword elimination, and stemming (PorterStemmer).

📚 Feature Engineering:
Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF representations of movie reviews.

📊 Model Training:
Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) trained using the TF-IDF matrix.

🔍 Evaluation:
Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score assessments.
ROC curves to visualize classifier performance.

🚀 Model Comparison:
Logistic Regression achieved higher accuracy, while KNN performance was evaluated for comparison.
The project highlights the significance of text preprocessing and explores the strengths and weaknesses of different classifiers in sentiment prediction.

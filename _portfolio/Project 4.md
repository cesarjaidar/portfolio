Description:

This project showcases the process of generating images from text prompts using Stability AI's Stable Diffusion API. Key highlights include:

🎨 API Integration: Configuration and execution of POST requests to Stability AI for image generation.

📄 Prompt Engineering: Testing prompts for creative outputs, such as a dog in front of a decorated Christmas tree.

🖼️ File Handling: Conversion from .webp to .png for Jupyter Notebook visualization.

💡 Comparative Analysis: Evaluation of Stability AI outputs against OpenAI and DeepAI models, discussing realism and prompt adherence.

The project highlights the strengths and limitations of Stability AI's cost-effective "core" model while exploring the trade-offs between price and output quality.

Description:

This project leverages social media engagement data to explore patterns in audience interactions and predict future engagement rates. Key highlights include:

📊 Data Preprocessing:
Removal of irrelevant columns and duplicates.
Encoding categorical variables using dummy encoding and ordinal encoding.
Feature engineering for time-based patterns (day of the week, quarter, and month).
Creation of ratio features (likes/shares, shares/comments).

🎨 Visualizations:
Bar plots and box plots to show engagement across platforms and post types.
World heatmaps of engagement rates by country.

🔍 Modeling:
Logistic regression and random forest models predict audience sentiment.
Random forest and XGBoost regressors forecast engagement rates, with hyperparameter tuning through grid search.
Model performance is evaluated with MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² metrics.

🌍 Geographic Focus:
Targeted analysis of Italy and Croatia with engagement and sentiment heatmaps.
The project highlights the value of feature engineering and visualization in deriving actionable insights from social media data, providing a framework for audience engagement prediction at both global and country levels.

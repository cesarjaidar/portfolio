# Introduction

I am Cesar Jaidar, an IT professional with extensive experience in data and analytics, currently serving as the Director of Data & Analytics at Tyson Foods. Since stepping into this role in July 2023, I have been focused on driving strategic data initiatives, aligning technology solutions with business objectives, and fostering innovation across the organization.

Prior to my current position, I advanced through leadership roles at Tyson Foods, including Senior Manager and Manager of Data & Analytics. In these roles, I led cross-functional teams in developing and deploying application solutions that enhanced operational efficiency and supported enterprise-wide goals.

I am also pursuing a Master’s degree in Data Science from Belleview University, further strengthening my expertise in analytics, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. This combination of leadership experience and continued academic development enables me to deliver impactful solutions in the rapidly evolving data and technology landscape.

# What to Expect

This GitHub page serves as a platform to track and share my data science projects. Here, I will document practical applications of machine learning, data analysis, and visualization techniques, highlighting both academic and professional projects. I hope this repository not only reflects my progress but also contributes to the broader data science community.
